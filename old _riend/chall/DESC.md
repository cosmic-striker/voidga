ðŸ“œ Challenge Description:
In the year 2147, after the collapse of Earthâ€™s digital infrastructure, humanity uploaded the rules of every game to a deep-space archive known as The Void Nexus. Among them, one mysterious program was flagged by an ancient AI as "strategic warfare simulation" â€” but itâ€™s actually a gameâ€¦ or is it?

Youâ€™ve recovered this terminal-based Void Cricket Simulation, disguised as a harmless version of an old human sport â€” hand cricket. But something is off. The AI opponent plays unusually smart. Certain actions get you eliminated without warning. And no matter how many times you win, the flag remains hidden.

Your mission is to:

Decode the true rules.

Defeat the AI.

Prove youâ€™re the master of the void sport.

Only then will the simulation unlock the hidden void transmission flag buried deep within the gameâ€™s core.

"In space, no one can hear you appeal for LBW..."
