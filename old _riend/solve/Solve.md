Hidden CTF Rules (Discovered via Reverse Engineering / Trial & Error):
To get the flag, you must meet all of the following:

🎯 Win a game (either by chasing or defending).

❌ Never use 2 or 6 while batting.

Doing so immediately gets you OUT, but without any explanation.

This is a hidden trap — only visible in the source or with clever deduction.

🔁 Play the game at least 10 full times.

The flag will only show after 10 rounds have been completed, to increase difficulty.

Only clean wins (without 2/6) count toward the flag condition.
